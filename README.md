PCL Algebra/Math engine

A practice repo where I'm messing with building a basic algebra engine.

Converts algebraic strings into workable order of operations trees, and performs a series of transforms on those trees in attempt to reduce or solve the equation.

Currently only algebraic reduction is implemented.
